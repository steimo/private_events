<h1 style="margin-top: 0px;">Eventlite</h1>

<p>This project involves building a private website with similar functionality to <a href="(https://www.eventbrite.com/)">Eventbrite</a> where users can create and manage events and attend events hosted by other users.</p>

### Overview:

The application focuses on the use of ActiveRecord's associations by requiring many-to-many relationships, foreign keys and custom class names. A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. Events take place at a specific date and at a location. Creators of an event can edit or delete their events as well. User can create account with an email and password (authentication and authorization system is set up through the [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) gem).
